The Ramen Rating App is a simple web application that allows users to view, add, and rate different ramen dishes.

I created a new project folder: ramen-rating-app Inside, I set up three main files: index.html (for the webpage structure) style.css (for styling) index.js (for JavaScript functionality) I initialized a Git repository and made regular commits while coding.

Fuction:displayRamens() used an array of ramen objects (ramens[]) as my dataset. I looped through the ramens array using forEach() and created  elements. These images were appended to the #ramen-menu div. Clicking on an image triggers an event that updates the ramen details

Fuction:displayRamenDetails(ramen) When a user clicks an image, this function updates the #ramen-detail section to show: Ramen name Restaurant name Rating Comment

Fuction:addSubmitListener() I added an event listener to the form that allows users to add a new ramen. It retrieves user input values and dynamically updates the DOM by appending a new image.

Fuction:main() To ensure everything loads properly, I created a main() function that: Calls displayRamens() to show ramen images on page load. Calls addSubmitListener() to enable user input handling.

Auto-load first ramenâ€™s details on page load Allow users to update ratings and comments Enable deleting a ramen from the list

i stuctured this code in different fuctions i kept it more orgernised Each function has a specific purpose, making it easier to read or debug
